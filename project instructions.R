#MovieLens Project Instructionsfile, a report in the form of a PDF document knit from your Rmd file, and an R script that generates your predicted movie ratings and calculates RMSE. Your grade for the project will be based on two factors:
  
#The submission for the MovieLens project will be three files: a report in the form of an Rmd 
#Your report and script (75%)
#The RMSE returned by testing your algorithm on the validation set (25%)
#Please note that once you submit your project, you will not be able to make changes to your 
#submission.

#Report and Script (75%)
#Your report and script will be graded by your peers, based on a rubric defined by the course 
#staff. Each submission will be graded by three peers and the median grade will be awarded. To 
#receive your grade, you must review and grade the submissions of five of your fellow learners 
#after submitting your own. This will give you the chance to learn from your peers.

#Please pay attention to the due dates listed! The project submission is due before the end of 
#the course to allow time for peer grading. Also note that you must grade the reports of your 
#peers by the course close date in order to receive your grìade.

#RMSE (25%)
#Your movie rating predictions will be compared to the true ratings in the validation set using 
#RMSE. Be sure that your report includes the RMSE and that your R script outputs the RMSE.

#IMPORTANT: Make sure you do NOT use the validation set to train your algorithm. The validation 
#set should ONLY be used to test your final algorithm. You should split the edx data into a 
#training and test set.

#Honor Code
#You are welcome to discuss your project with others, but all submitted work must be your own. 
#Your participation in this course is governed by the terms of the edX Honor Code. Violations of 
#the edX Honor Code are grounds for receiving a zero on the project, being removed from the 
#course, and/or being stripped of your certificate.

#Project Due Date
#Submissions for the Movielens project are due one week before course close, on June 23, 2020, 
#at 23:59 UTC. This allows time for peer grading to occur! Peer grades are due at course close, 
#on June 30, 2020, at 23:59 UTC.

#Peer Feedback
#You are strongly encouraged to give your peers thoughtful, specific written feedback in 
#addition to the numerical grades in the rubic. Think about the type of feedback that would 
#help you improve your work and offer that type of feedback to your fellow learners.
